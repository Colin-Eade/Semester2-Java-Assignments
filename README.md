# Semester 2 - Object Oriented Programming 1 Assignments
**Date:** Winter 2023

This repository features a collection of assignments from the 'Object Oriented Programming 1' course, which is part of my second semester within the Computer Programming and Analysis program. The assignments presented here delve deeper into the concepts of object-oriented programming, employing Java to tackle a variety of challenges. From creating console applications to developing graphical user interfaces, these projects display my progression in understanding and applying OOP principles. They showcase my technical skills I've developed and my ability to think abstractly and solve more complex problems through code.
