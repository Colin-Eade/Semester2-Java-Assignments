# Assignment 1 - AstrologicalZodiacSigns
**Date:** January 28, 2022

The "Astrological Zodiac Signs" application is a program designed to determine a user's zodiac sign based on their birth date. By integrating fundamental programming principles with a terminal-based interface, this app provides a personalized astrological reading. Users are prompted to enter their birth date in a numeric format, and the application calculates which of the twelve zodiac signs corresponds to their date of birth. This project showcases the application of basic Java syntax, control structures, conditional statements, class implementation, and user input validation.
